    <body>
        My name is Sophia Herrera, and I am a 20-year-old queer Latina woman. At Syracuse University, I major in Television, Radio, and Film (TRF) production in the S.I. Newhouse School of Communications. I am passionate about the production of film and television and strive to work as an executive producer. I minor in Information Management and Technology (IMT) at the iSchool as well. I have always had an interest in technology and enjoy learning about the endless possibilities of technological advancements. I have created my own content and small personal projects in film and photography. I am proficient in working with cameras and exploring new prospectives. These works have excelled my use of Adobe programs and the ability to create and share stories. My desired work and hobbies align as I enjoy watching film and TV in my free time and learning different techniques or about directors and renowned actors. I enjoy making lists and film reviews on social media and following content by artists. A personal hobby that I enjoy is building LEGO sets or playing video games such as Minecraft or Pok√©mon. Not only do I like to collect LEGO sets, but I have a vast collection of classic cameras ranging from the 1930s-1980s. I enjoy restoring them and taking pictures with different films. I manage my free time in balance with my hobbies, or self-care in which I enjoy going hiking, to parks or trails, and spending time exercising. At Syracuse, I am always looking to deepen my interest and create routine between my desired work, academics, and my personal interests.
