                My name is Sophia Herrera, and I am a 20-year-old queer Latina woman. At Syracuse University, I major in <strong>Television, Radio, and Film (TRF)</strong> production in the S.I. Newhouse School of Communications. I am passionate about the production of film and television and strive to work as an executive producer. I minor in <strong>Information Management and Technology (IMT)</strong> at the iSchool as well. I have always had an interest in technology and enjoy learning about the endless possibilities of technological advancements. 
            </P>
            <p>
                I have created my own content and small personal projects in film and photography. I am proficient in working with cameras and exploring new prospectives. These works have excelled my use of Adobe programs and the ability to create and share stories.

            <h2>Personal Info</h2>
                <p>
                    My desired work and hobbies align as I enjoy watching film and TV in my free time and learning different techniques or about directors and renowned actors. I enjoy making lists and film reviews on social media and following content by artists. A personal hobby that I enjoy is building LEGO sets or playing video games such as Minecraft or Pok√©mon. Not only do I like to collect LEGO sets, but I have a vast collection of classic cameras ranging from the 1930s-2000s. I enjoy restoring them and taking pictures with different films. I manage my free time in balance with my hobbies, or self-care in which I enjoy going hiking, to parks or trails, and spending time exercising.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Syracuse, I am always looking to deepen my interest and create routine between my desired work, academics, and my personal interests.
